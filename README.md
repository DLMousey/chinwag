Tinkering around with the "hello world" of websockets, a chat application.
This repo includes both the client and server implementations.

## Run the application
You'll need 2 terminal windows/tabs.

**First tab - client**
- `cd client`
- `npm start` - this will start a webpack dev server accessible on localhost:8090

**Second tab - server**
- `cd server`
- `node server.js`

... Bit anti-climatic really wasn't it?
